                        <p className="text-sm mt-4 text-start ml-8 text-gray-400">Simply put, when a lawsuit involves multiple plaintiffs against one or more defendants, it is known as a mass tort action. In other words, a mass tort is civil litigation that consists of a single accidental or intentional action that causes many people to sustain injuries. The biggest benefit of joining a mass tort claim is that it increases your chances of recovering damages from entities such as product and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Mass tort actions are different from class actions because each plaintiffâ€™s case will be reviewed individually.</p>
